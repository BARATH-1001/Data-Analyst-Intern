# WIPRO
During my data science internship at **Wipro** in collaboration with **Corizo Edutech**, I had the opportunity to work on impactful projects that honed my technical expertise and deepened my understanding of machine learning and data analytics.

One of the key projects I completed was a **Wine Classification** project, where I built predictive models to classify wines based on various chemical properties, including acidity, alcohol content, pH levels, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, I developed models that provided highly accurate categorizations, helping to differentiate between high-quality and low-quality wines. This project refined my skills in feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

Additionally, I worked on a **Stock Price Prediction** project, utilizing machine learning algorithms and **time series analysis** to forecast future stock trends. I applied techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, and regression models to analyze historical stock data, predict market movements, and assess potential investment outcomes. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my proficiency in handling large datasets, performing trend analysis, and implementing predictive analytics models.

These projects not only advanced my technical abilities but also provided practical insights into the power of data science in diverse fields, from finance to consumer goods.
