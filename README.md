# WIPRO
During my data science internship at Wipro via Corizo Edutech, I completed a wine classification project, building models to categorize wines based on features like acidity and alcohol content. I also worked on a stock prediction project, using machine learning and time series analysis to forecast stock prices, enhancing my skills in data field.
